# Network Analysis
Network analysis of co-authorship of scientists working on network theory and experiment. These data are based on the bibliographies of two review articles on networks, SIAM Review 45, 167-256 (2003) and Physics Reports 424, 175-308 (2006), with some additional references added by hand. The network is weighted by nature.
